Hi! I'm a first-year PhD student at [S3D](https://s3d.cmu.edu) within Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science, jointly advised by [Lorrie Cranor](https://lorrie.cranor.org) and [Hoda Heidari](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hheidari/). 


I graduated from Harvey Mudd College in 2024, where I majored in Computer Science and Math. As an undergraduate, I spent two summers at Carnegie Mellon University's CyLab working with Lorrie Cranor [<span style="color:#800080">usable security & privacy</span>], one summer at MIT's IDSS with Peko Hosoi [<span style="color:#800080">housing equity & algorithmic fairness</span>], two semesters with Professor Susan Martonosi [<span style="color:#800080">misinformation on social media</span>], and two semesters with Lawrence Livermore National Labs through the Harvey Mudd Clinic Program [<span style="color:#800080">empirical scaling laws in machine learning</span>].
